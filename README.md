# Colored Markers
This is a project for the "Learn CSS Colors by Building a Set of Colored Markers" tutorial by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). In this project, we'll create a set of colored markers using CSS and HTML.

##  Description

In this project, we will create a set of colored markers using HTML and CSS. The markers will have different colors and a distinct design for the cap and sleeve. The project includes a simple HTML structure and corresponding CSS styles.

## Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the markers and the necessary HTML elements.
- `styles.css`: This file contains the CSS styles used to design the colored markers.


## Marker Colors

- **Red Marker**: The red marker has a gradient background and a box shadow with a red hue.
- **Green Marker**: The green marker features a gradient background with a green color and a green-hued box shadow.
- **Blue Marker**: The blue marker uses an HSL gradient for its background and a blue box shadow.

##  Goal
The goal of this project is to learn and practice working with CSS to create visually appealing and colorful markers. By following this project, you'll gain insights into working with CSS properties like gradients, box shadows, and more.

Feel free to experiment with the code and make your own variations to further enhance your CSS skills.
Enjoy building your set of colored markers and exploring the world of CSS colors!
